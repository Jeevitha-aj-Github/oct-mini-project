# OCT Mini Project

This mini project explores automated analysis of retinal OCT B-scans.  
It demonstrates a simple workflow for going from a raw clinical-style scan to  
basic structural features that could feed into structure–function models.

## What this project shows

- loading and visualising a retinal OCT B-scan
- extracting an intensity profile along a central scan line
- simple automated retinal layer boundary highlighting using Sobel edge detection
- basic retinal morphometry foundations (foveal pit and layer transitions)
- early steps towards machine-learning-ready OCT features

## Skills demonstrated

- Python programming
- scientific plotting with Matplotlib
- numerical processing with NumPy
- basic computer vision (Sobel edge detection)
- image analysis applied to retinal OCT scans

## How to run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jeevitha-aj-Github/oct-mini-project.git
