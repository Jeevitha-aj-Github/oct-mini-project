OCT Mini Project

This project is a beginner-friendly exploration of automated analysis of retinal OCT images.
It includes basic preprocessing, intensity profiling, and edge detection to highlight important retinal structures.

This is an early version of the project and will grow gradually with more analysis and visualisation.
