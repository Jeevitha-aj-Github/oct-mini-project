OCT Mini Project

This project is a beginner-friendly exploration of automated analysis of retinal OCT images.
It includes preprocessing, intensity profiling, and simple edge detection to highlight retinal layer boundaries.

This is an early version, and the project will grow gradually with more advanced analysis.

What This Project Demonstrates

The methods used here are the first essential steps for:

automated retinal layer boundary detection

retinal morphometry

structure–function analysis

clinical OCT processing

machine learning applications for retinal imaging

This mini-project shows practical skills in:

Python

scientific plotting (Matplotlib)

numerical processing (NumPy)

basic computer vision (Sobel edge detection)

All applied specifically to retinal OCT data.
